 %This article discussed the historical overt and subtle forms of discrimination women in tech have faced since the 1930's, and the gradual decline of women in IT since the 1980's. It discussed recruitment in K-12 by holding summer camps and programs for girls who might not otherwise consider CS, and recruitment in universities though connecting CS to fields that women express interest in. The fifth and final section of this paper discussed the importance of debunking gender myths and how important it is for women to have role models, mentors, and support.

 The authors discussed the lack of women in CS and hypothesized that some women leave because they feel isolated in predominately male classes. Isolation can be demotivating, but can also lead to exclusion from study groups and otherwise impede learning. They created the tool Piazza, a free discussion tool for STEM students. In this article, they compare engagement across gender, as well as the amount of questions that are asked and answered. They found a gender gap that did not exist in the humanities, social sciences, or business--- it was unique to students in STEM and CS.},

 %The author discussed the reputation of the Stanford University course CS107 to be a "weeder." Although such courses are thought to have a "disproportionate negative effect on women and minorities [7], this one does not. However, the women in this course tend to rate their male peers as significantly more comfortable with computers than they are. Students of both genders described the CS major is being split into two tribes, or groups: those who struggle and those who do well. Although prior experience is often thought to be a significant factor, this study found that the ability to cope with stress, coding speed, and confidence in one's coding ability were the main differences between students who persist in the major and those who leave. Although some believe that men are more likely to be successful in a CS course, the biggest difference across gender is confidence: men tend to have much more of it.

The author talks about her decision to require students to self-grade their participation and preparedness at the end of a lecture, and her surprise when, after several weeks of doing this, she discovered that female students were consistently underrating their performance and writing comments about their lack of ability to understand material or contribute to the classroom.

 % This article discusses the effectiveness of a mentoring program, Women in Computing Science (WICS) at a Canadian University. WICS hosted five kinds of events: technical events, social events, general meetings, industry-related events, and conferences. The program was designed with the goal of students taking on the majority of leadership roles, building relationships in the major, and encouraging each other to remain in the major. The paper concludes by recommending that mentoring programs like this diversify so that there is a style of activity that all students will enjoy. They noted that multi-faceted recruitment plans can also be helpful: they used LinkedIn, Facebook, blogs, and word of mouth (both professors and students).

 %This article discussed barriers to women in CS that are similar to the barriers all women in STEM face: discriminatory behavior, differences in the way males and females evaluate their own behavior, a lack of female role models or female supportive peer communities. Unique to women in CS, many students also face: a lack of prior experience (that their male peers do have), an uncomfortable CS culture, and social biases in the design of computing systems. A graph of data from NSF showed the numbers and percentages of CS degrees granted to students since 1970. In response to these issues, the CS community at Stanford changed the structure of the CS major and designed several programs for K-12 and college students. In particular, they created CURIS (for undergraduate research experiences), a stepping-stone role model program (where students are mentored by those who are "one step ahead" instead of having freshmen being mentored by those 20 years into a career), SSEA (for students the summer between graduating high school and enrolling in college engineering courses), ACE (a program to prevent attrition of STEM majors during introductory calculus courses), and a sophomore-professor mentoring program (which dispels the myth that CS is only about programming). },

publisher={W.W. Norton \& Company},
author={Steele, Claude},
year={2011},
keywords={stereotypes, pedagogy, race},
note={\\\\Minorities can partly overcome negative consequences of stereotype threat by short affirmation exercises. The data in this book was originally gathered from minority students at Stanford University and the University of Michigan; more data was collected from other heavily stereotyped groups like the elderly, inner-city high school students, and working class people. I intend to use some of his data about negative consequences of stereotype threat.},

publisher={Ethnography and Assessment Research, Bureau of Sociological Research, University of Colorado},
author={Seymour, Elaine and Hewitt, Nancy M.},
year={1994},
keywords={retention},
note={\\\\STEM majors are much more likely to drop out of school or switch majors than humanities students are; people leave because they are not sufficiently prepared in high school, college courses are too difficult, or possible careers and lifestyles do not look appealing. The data in this book came from 1990-1993 from seven different four-year institutions through surveys and interviews. I intend to use this in my discussion of how things have changed in the past several decades. },
