        "question2": "at the beginning and throughout, because i can know what is going on so i can see how the data correlates, and also because it is much easier to recognize visually when something is happening.",
        "question3": "Data is good after being able to recognize the patterns from the video, and helps because once said pattern is recognized, it makes the process a lot faster.",
        "question4": "It is always necessary to have video because there could be an action that isnt what we are looking for that shows up as similar on the data and could be mistakenly annotated. some of the data was also very difficult to differentiate from one action to the next. also there was not a sufficient amount of time to be able to consistently learn to recognize patterns"
