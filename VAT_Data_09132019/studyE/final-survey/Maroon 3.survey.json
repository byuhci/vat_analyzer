        "question2": "Very essential on the Drywall video because there are so many things that he could be doing during those events, whereas the gait and cane have either down or up. Those are the only two options.",
        "question3": "when the event occurs off screen, like when the cane was below the FOV of the camera",
        "question4": "Needs to be done on a machine that doesn't lag, I had some issues with the videos loading and buttons not executing when they should."
