        "question2": "Video is essential for establishing patterns in the data. I think it also helps differentiate between pertinent movement/contact and un-related movement",
        "question3": "Data is helpful when video isn't clear, and for mapping out more specific time widnows for events. (like the precise moment the cane makes contact with the ground)",
        "question4": "I found myself stumbling over the controls, despite the tutorial video. I think it would help if i could drag event boxes across data in addition to being able to adjust the start/emd points after placing."
