        "question1": "Gait, Cane, Drywall",
        "question2": "Video is essenial when you can clearly tell what the action is doing. The strength in this is pretty precise visual-based data on what event goes on and more importantly when.",
        "question3": "Data becomes really essential when one can recognize patterns. When there is a force of similar size over and over again, I noticed it was much easier than watching the video to determine when an event was occuring, or at the very least, when there was transitioning between events",
        "question4": "I think as a human subject we can also relay events based on sound. Yes reading the data and watching it is helpful, but I feel with the drywall example, I bet the majority would better recognize when the dry wall was being cut, measured, crowbared etc."
