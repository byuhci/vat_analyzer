        "question2": "When the data has lots of noise between events, video is necessary to see which spikes in the data correspond to the events to mark. Video is also essential (at least in the beginning) to recognize the pattern the data follows on events.",
        "question3": "Data is essential to get precise timing of events and for when the events happen off-screen.",
        "question4": "If this were for actual use, I would want more time to verify my tagging/be more precise about it. Also, I think video would always be helpful unless the data is guaranteed to be completely noiseless between events."
