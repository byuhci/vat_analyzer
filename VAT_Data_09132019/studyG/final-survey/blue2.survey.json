        "question2": "the video is essential to understand the data. If more time were given to link the video to the data it would be easier to analyze just the data afterwards",
        "question3": "It can be analyzed a lot quicker than a video, but without a video to give context to the data, it's hard to understand",
        "question4": "I think it would be better to have 5 minutes to watch the video and the data together without worrying about annotation, then I could easily annotate the data without the video afterwards"
