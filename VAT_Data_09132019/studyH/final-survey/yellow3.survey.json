        "question2": "Video is essential for the first and most of the following trials because it allows for recognition of an event that can then be paired with the data. With the video, I can recognize what event is occurring, and annotate accordingly. I can also learn which data corresponds to the events shown in the video.",
        "question3": "Data is essential starting with the second trial and thereafter, because it allows for analysis of the measurable qualities of an event. The data allows for greater accuracy in pinpointing when the event is occurring, as it is easier to see than the video when something starts or stops.",
        "question4": "I don't feel like there was enough time given to accurately and clearly annotate the videos. Maybe I'm just slow,. :-)"
