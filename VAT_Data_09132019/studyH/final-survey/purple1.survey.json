        "question2": "Video is essential for learning to associate the actual events with their data patterns. Also, some data points (like measuring with a tape measure) are not recognizable enough from the data alone.",
        "question3": "Data helps to get more accuracy than just looking at the video. Also, after learning the data patterns, it is much quicker to annotate the data alone than watching the video and annotating.",
        "question4": "Data is a big assist for events that have a distinct pattern, to the point where it can largely eliminate the need for video except for sanity checking."
