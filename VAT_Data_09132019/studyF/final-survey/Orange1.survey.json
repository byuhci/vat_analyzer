        "question2": "The video is essential when I am first seeing a set of data so that I can determine what event I am seeing in the data.",
        "question3": "The data is always useful because it helps me to see if there there are patterns that can be recognized without the video.  However, some events are so quiet that the data doesn't show very clear starts and ends to events.",
        "question4": "I did not feel very confident with the tasks after the short training.  I also felt that the time was too short.  I would get caught up in watching the video rather than comparing it with the data, so when I only had data I was basically blindly guessing."
