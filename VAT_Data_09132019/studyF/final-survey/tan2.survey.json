        "question2": "I never saw any cutting motion, so I had no idea what to look for in the data to mark. It was also essential the first time to be able to associate visually when the motion happened with a pattern in the data.",
        "question3": "Over time, and with simple motions that had a very defined pattern or was repeated several times.",
        "question4": "It was a little frustrating when the movements werent as defined (ie cutting/measuring) when I didnt have the video to compare with the data. It was nice to have the data however when the camera couldnt capture in the frame what the man cutting was doing."
