        "question2": "Video is essential at the start because you need to understand what events are happening, and when they happen. You can more easily match up the event with the data.",
        "question3": "Data is also essential at the start because you can see what a particular event looks like data-wise. Once you understand what that event looks like, you can then determine what is happening only by looking at the data because of your previous experience.",
        "question4": "It was difficult when the video was 17 - 23 minutes long, and we only had 2-3 minutes to complete the task. It was also difficult to see when some events occurred because humans were blocking the view."
