question,Is there anything else that you would like to say about video annotation?
""
"I felt with this test, I was not able to do all the events with the given time. If I wanted more events, Id have to manually skip around in the video. This still felt rushed as I was only jumping really small intervals. I feared jumping across more intervals due to not wanting to miss an event. I feel that the video was greatly beneficial to the fact that you knew for sure what event was happening. It decreases chance for an error tremendously, but I like to have the data alongside it so that I can know at what periods in time I can skip to to analyze the next event."
I think it is a really helpful and awesome idea.
I would specify what exactly determines the beginning and end of the action so that the margin of error is not as big.
"If the video loaded faster while scrolling through, the data wouldn't have been as useful. The data still would've been extremely useful, just not as useful. Extra people running around didn't faze me at all."
"It is a useful tool to help develop the tools but probably it will take more than 3 time for people to get used to it. It is really user friendly as well. For  the data part, if there's a function where we can zoom in and out in order to get more accurate results, that would be easier and better."
"It's very difficult to detiermine when an event occurs when it's preceded by other motion, such as a transition from a walk to a run."
No.
The data was much easier to use than the video.
"The software was relatively easy to use.  I wish I had more time to get used to more keyboard shortcuts, because I feel that would've increased my efficiency."
"This is really cool, I would love to learn more."

question,When and why is data essential? 
"Data is essential because it is as obnoxious as h*** trying to enter anything without it. It's annoying to have to sit and watch boring periods of nothing happening, and then when something does happen you have to scrub through the video to figure out when the event starts and stops instead of being able to see it from the data patterns."
"Data is essential for fast annotating, especially annotating a video that has long periods of inactivity. It's hard to scan through the video looking for events, but its super easy to see the data and jump straight to the point where the accelerometer starts acting up. You can't do that with video only."
"Data is essential throughout the annotating process because it allows you to precisely measure when an event begins and ends.  With the video alone it can be hard to do this, but the data is much more concrete."
Data is essential when you are observing a large amount of data where patterns and themes can be detected relatively easily. It would be handy to have data in the lengthier running and pill videos where it is easy to discern what types of events are occuring.
"Data is never strictly necessary, but makes tagging much more accurate."
"Data isn't necessarily essential in the beginning, but it is essential in the beginning to have better accuracy and also to recognize which event correlates with what data."
Data was necessary for pinpointing when an action started. Other wise I am left to guessing when something starts and finishes off a crappy video
"For me data was most beneficial as a means to skip around in the video. With only the video you'd have to wait for an event, resulting in wasted time. Seeing the data made for faster work and more gave more events to process. With more events processed, the better the machine will be at learning events itself."
I found the data to be essential most with the cane video because it helped me determine when exactly the cane hit the ground. The others (pills and running) I could determine the start and end point pretty accurately based on the video shown.
It's essential on the first round so that I can match the data of the event with the moves. It saves more time at the rounds after if I can differentiate the data of each moves and it's also more accurate.
The data is always essential- even with the video. It makes it much easier to know when to look at the video and makes it more efficient
"the data is essential at the beginning to link patterns with the events ocurring, and when there are other factors that influence the data, such as a transition from a walk to a run."

question,When and why is video essential?
I found the video to be essential when recording the Pill data because the different between taking the pill and just movement was a little to close to be 100% accurate with just data. The video made the data inputted more accurate and reliable.
"It's essential on the first round so that I can match the data of the event with the moves. For the rounds after, I feel like data is more useful if I can differentiate the data of each moves."
"The video is essential at first so that you can see what the data is telling you, but once you are able to recognize the pattern of the data it's not essential."
The video is essential at the beginning to link patterns in the data to the events ocurring.
The video is essential for the first round so the computer or the user can see the pattern of what action makes what data pattern.
"The video is essential in mapping motion with data. If you only had data, then you'd make assumptions of what it means. But when you saw it youd have more confirmation of what it means, and the margin of error in the future when analyzing data would be less."
"The video is extremely helpful when you're first annotating a task, to help you learn which data patterns match which actions.  If you can never make that association, then there's no guarantee that you'll be marking the correct patterns in the data."
"Video is essential at first to recognize the difference between the different types of events, and later it is a helpful way of verifying that a data pattern actually represents the thing it looks like. It's also helpful to distinguish events when the data doesn't clearly look like one thing or another."
"Video is essential for tagging the running data. Without video, it was nearly impossible to differentiate between running and skipping. For the other data sets, video was less important."
"Video is essential the first time around. It's essential because you need to see what's going on. If I didn't see the video paired with the data, I wouldn't be able to identify what exactly was happening during certain data points."
"Video is essential when there is lots of movement occuring, such as the cane example, and it can be difficult to observe patterns in data when there is lots of movement."
Video was only necessary when I was trying to analyze the data and noticing patterns between the two.

question,"Please rank these data sets in order of difficulty, from the easiest to annotate (accurately and efficiently) to the hardest: Pill, Running, Cane"
"Cane was pretty difficult (expecially with video, I kept scrubbing to see when it actually lifted off the ground), Then running (It was easier to pick out when skipping, and walking and then by elimination choose when running occured), then pills. The Gyro data really helped to show what and when things were happening. Probably because it was a stationary object."
"Cane, Pill, Running"
"I found the running data easiest to annotate because there was a more distinct difference shown between running and skipping in the data set. I found that the pill was neutral, at times I could tell with the data sat if it was movement or taking the pill however I was never 100% sure or accurate without the video. I found the cane to be most difficult, just because I didn't quite know exactly when the can hit the ground or came off the ground or if you were looking for the whole cane on the ground or just a part of it."
"I would put running as easiest, then pills, then cane. Cane was first because it lifted and lowered quickly, there was not much room between round. The margin of error when starting or stopping could increase due to this. The pills were easier to me. The difficulty would arise when someone would move the bottle with more force, the signal could mix with that of opening the bottle. But I feel that movement would be more stretched out, and I didn't see that case much. Running was easiest. running was steady, while jogging was less so. Also jogging's motion was squezed more. For me the distinction was easy to see."
